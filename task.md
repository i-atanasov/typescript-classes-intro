# Typescript project + unit tests
Create a TypeScript console application that will read information for two hotels from a csv file and a json file and display that information on the screen.

## Must have
- An interface that will describe the room information
- An abstract class which will act as a base reader functionality. It will later be implemented by two other classes that will read either csv or json files (doesnâ€™t need to be static but recommended)
- A class that will get a reader and file location as parameters and use them to display information on the console

## The project can also have
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) configuration
- Descriptive README
- You can include an UML or any other diagram explaining the architecture

## Out of scope
- Interaction with the user
- Any kind of user interface

## Next steps
- As an optional step you can test the functionality with unit tests (over 70% preferably)
